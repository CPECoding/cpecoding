<p>Geometry Dash is a game made in August 13,2013 by RobTop Games.RobTop is Swedish and his real name is known as Robert Topala.The current update is 2.1 right now.The next update,2.2,will include new building features,a new vehicle,new levels and more.The purpose of the game is to beat levels and other stuff and also achieve icons,ships,balls,UFOs,waves,robots,spiders,death effects and trails.There are demon chests that you can unlock using demon keys from chests or levels and unlock demon chests with it.Some demon chests require 5 demon keys because it has more rare items than normal demon chests.Many people played this game and there were very well known players such as Riot(Cyclic’s rival,good player,and creator of straight fly and best straight flyer),Cyclic(Riot’s rival,also good player),Michigun(one of the top best players),Brandon Larkin(best Xbox player and rager) and many other people.There is such thing as “mod” short for moderator,is when you can rate any level.And of course I don’t deserve to moderator because I’m trash at the game and don’t make any good levels,AND I DON’T EVEN HAVE A FEATURED LEVEL.Ok let’s just get on to why this game was made.This game was made to challenge you to see how good you are at passing these hard,desk-banging,also easy,levels.There are also REALLY COOL and hard levels such as Idols made in several level designs by Zafkiel7 and many other creators and verified by Dorami and also not to mention Zodiac verified by xander556 and the level by Bianox and more creators.The main levels are Stereo Madness,Back On Track,Poltergeist,Dry Out,Base After Base,Can’t Let Go,Jumper,Time Machine,Cycles,xStep,Clutterfunk,Theory Of Everything,Electroman Adventures,ClubStep,Electrodynamix,Hexagon Force,Blast Processing,Theory Of Everything 2,Geometrical Dominator,Deadlocked,and Finger dash.There are also gauntlets which has levels that represent it’s name.You can create your own levels!There are weekly demons and also daily levels(DAILY LEVELS ARE NOT DEMONS,ONLY DIFFICULTIES BELOW IT AND ONLY DEMONS ARE ONLY IN WEEKLY DEMONS)including map packs,featured levels,and “Hall Of Fame” levels.The difficulties are,N/A,Auto,Easy,Normal,Hard,Harder,Insane,Easy Demon,Medium Demon,Hard Demon,Insane Demon,and Extreme Demon.There is a section where it shows other player’s scores.The “Quests” section shows you what to do in order to achieve prizes.The “Search” section is where you can search levels you would want to play.Also there are secrets are included that you can discover,but are hard to discover.In my opinion,I think that I still could be professional at the game even though I am a mobile player and PC and Xbox is a better platform to play Geometry Dash on.I still convince you to play Geometry Dash even though you can’t afford to get a PC or Xbox, but only have a phone or a tablet because I have a phone instead of a tablet and still manage to pass demons or any kind of difficulty.So,keep trying and you’ll eventually pass that level you really hate and rage-quit A LOT on.So far,this is all I have left.Hope you had a fun time learning more information about the game.Thank You!
