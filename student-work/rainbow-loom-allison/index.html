<h2>How To Make a Rainbow loom starburst</h2>
<p>
First get all your stuff including a color of your choice in rubber bands about 40 middle color and about 40 outside color. You will also need a loom preferably a large loom and a strong hook or the hook may snap. Make sure the arrow on your loom  is facing you.Then put you outside color around the the loom on the right side once you make it to the end take one back and tilt it to the left and do the same on the left but tilt to the right then start making a star do that by going to the middle and going to the top right a go clockwise do that with the rest until you reach the end now we have to make cap bands do that by taking two fingers and one band make a 8 and wrap around your finger and put it on the other side(the other side of the red arrow ) and put in the middle of each star turn the loom over and now grab your handy dandy hook push the rest of the bands until you reach the last band and put it on the top right. Do the same thing clockwise until you reach the top of the star and hook the other color. do the same until you reach the end of the loom. now go back to the outside and go in oder doing this take your hook and grab the bottom and hook it to the one in front of this go in the same way you put the bands on. now take your hook and put  it all the way through the pin on the loom with the arrow and take the band up and over and tie a not and pull it off

<h3> Extension </h3>
<p>do the same thing to make the extension as you do on the outside of the starburst but as big as you need</p>
